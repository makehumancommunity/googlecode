/**
 * Lit Sphere (spherically mapped captured light) shader.
 * Has the effect of a specular material, shaded relative to the camera without
 * lights.
 * The normal is used as UV coordinates of the litsphere texture, which is a
 * spherically shaped mapping of colors for all angles that normals can face in
 * the half sphere facing the camera.
